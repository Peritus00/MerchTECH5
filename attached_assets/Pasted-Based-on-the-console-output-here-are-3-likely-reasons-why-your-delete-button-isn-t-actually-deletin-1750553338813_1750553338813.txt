Based on the console output, here are 3 likely reasons why your delete button isn't actually deleting the user in your React Native application, even though the confirmation dialog is being shown:

1.  **Missing or Unimplemented API Call for Deletion:**
    The logs clearly show that the application is successfully *fetching* users from `https://793b69da-5f5f-4ecb-a084-0d25bd48a221-00-mli9xfubddzk.picard.replit.dev:5000/api/admin/all-users` and that the delete button press is being registered. However, there's **no corresponding log indicating that an API call to delete the user is being made after the confirmation dialog.**
    * **Reason:** You're successfully identifying the user to delete and showing a confirmation, but the code to actually send a `DELETE` request to your backend API for that user ID is probably missing or not being triggered after the user confirms the deletion.

2.  **Confirmation Dialog Logic Not Triggering Deletion:**
    You're showing a delete confirmation dialog. This dialog usually has "Confirm" and "Cancel" buttons. The logs show the dialog *being shown* twice, but no subsequent action.
    * **Reason:** The function or event handler that's supposed to be called when the user *confirms* the deletion within that dialog is either not correctly wired up, or the logic inside that handler simply isn't making the API call to delete the user. You need to ensure that when the user clicks "Confirm" in the dialog, a specific function is executed that then makes the deletion API call.

3.  **Backend API Not Receiving or Processing the Delete Request (if an API call is being made but not logged):**
    While the logs don't *show* a delete API call, it's possible (though less likely given the current output) that your frontend *is* attempting to make one, but it's failing silently, or your backend isn't processing it correctly.
    * **Reason:** If you've implemented the API call on the frontend, the issue could be with your backend.
        * The endpoint for deleting a user might not be correctly set up or listening for `DELETE` requests.
        * There might be authentication/authorization issues on the backend preventing the deletion, even if the user is an admin (e.g., incorrect token validation for the delete endpoint).
        * The backend might be returning an error that your frontend isn't logging or handling.

**To debug this, you should:**

* **Inspect the code for the delete confirmation dialog's "Confirm" action.** Verify that it calls a function responsible for making the actual API call to delete the user.
* **Add console logs around your API deletion call.** This will help you see if the call is even being attempted and what its response is. For example, log before and after the `fetch` or `axios.delete` call.
* **Check your backend logs.** If you believe the API call is being made, look at your server logs to see if it's receiving the `DELETE` request and what its response is.
