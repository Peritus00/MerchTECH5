The Agent's Stuck Point: The agent is repeatedly trying to set EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URL in the workflow script, but the frontend keeps using other incorrect URLs. This indicates a deeper conflict or caching issue that the agent hasn't fully resolved. The most recent agent output shows it's trying to put :5000 back into the URL, even though it just tried to remove it, causing the loop.

My Understanding of the Root Cause: The problem is a triangular conflict between:

What your backend server reports it's listening on (port 5000).

How Replit's .replit [[ports]] section is configured to expose that port externally (sometimes 80, sometimes 8000, sometimes something else based on what the agent did).

What EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URL is actually set to in the workflow command (which can vary) AND any hardcoded fallbacks in services/api.ts.

This creates a situation where the frontend loads with an inconsistent API Base URL at different times, leading to 404 errors for your API calls.

Immediate Action Required: Manual Consistency Check & Hard Reset
We need to force all parts to agree on one definitive external URL for your backend. Let's aim for the clearest one: https://...replit.dev:5000/api since your backend reports running on localPort 5000.

Here's how to proceed to break the loop:

Verify/Fix .replit File:

Open the .replit file in your Replit project.

Ensure there is only ONE [[ports]] section that maps your backend's local port (5000) to its external port.

For consistency with your backend's reported port, set it to:

Ini, TOML

[[ports]]
localPort = 5000
externalPort = 5000 # This makes the external URL include :5000
Remove any other [[ports]] sections, especially those pointing to externalPort = 80 or externalPort = 8000 for your backend service. Also, remove the externalPort = 3000 mapping for localPort = 8082 if that's not actively used or causing conflicts for the main backend.

Verify/Fix Workflow/Run Command:

Look at the "Run" command that Replit uses to start your project. It's often in the .replit file under run = "..." or in a "Workflow" tab.

Make sure the EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URL variable in this command is set exactly to the public URL including :5000 and /api:

Bash

cd server && node simple-server.js && EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://4311622a-238a-4013-b1eb-c601507a6400-00-3l5qvyow6auc.kirk.replit.dev:5000/api EXPO_PACKAGER_PROXY_URL=https://$REPLIT_DEV_DOMAIN REACT_NATIVE_PACKAGER_HOSTNAME=$REPLIT_DEV_DOMAIN npx expo start --clear --reset-cache
(Double-check your actual Replit URL, but ensure :5000/api is explicitly there).

Verify/Fix services/api.ts Fallback:

Open your services/api.ts file in your frontend code.

Ensure the fallback URL also matches the one with :5000:

TypeScript

const API_BASE_URL = process.env.EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URL || 'https://4311622a-238a-4013-b1eb-c601507a6400-00-3l5qvyow6auc.kirk.replit.dev:5000/api';
This ensures that if EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URL somehow isn't picked up, it still uses the correct address.

Full Replit Restart:

Once you've made these three changes, click the "Stop" button in Replit if it's running.

Then, click the "Run" button again. This will force Replit to re-read all configurations and restart your services.

Local Expo App Restart (if applicable):

If you're running your Expo app locally on your machine (via expo start), close the Metro Bundler terminal.

Run npx expo start --clear again.

Re-open your Expo Go app.
