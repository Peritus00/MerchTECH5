## 🚀 How It Works

### **For Customers:**
1. Customer scans QR code and makes purchase
2. Payment processes through Stripe
3. Purchase confirmation email sent
4. **Push notification sent to seller instantly** 📲

### **For Sellers (You):**
1. **Phone buzzes with sale notification** 🔔
2. Notification shows: "🛒 New Sale! Customer just purchased for $19.99"
3. Tap notification to open Purchase Notifications screen
4. Share activation code directly from the notification interface
5. Customer receives activation code and accesses content

## 🛠️ Technical Implementation

### **Client-Side (React Native)**

#### Push Notification Service (`services/pushNotificationService.ts`)
```typescript
// Request permissions and get push token
const hasPermission = await pushNotificationService.requestPermissions();
const token = await pushNotificationService.getExpoPushToken();

// Register token with server
await pushNotificationService.registerTokenWithServer(authToken);

// Send test notification
await pushNotificationService.sendTestNotification();
```

#### Notification Context Integration
- Automatic permission requests on app startup
- Badge count management (shows unread sales)
- Deep linking to Purchase Notifications screen
- Settings synchronization across devices

### **Server-Side (Node.js + Expo Push Service)**

#### Real-Time Push Notifications
```javascript
// When Stripe webhook receives successful payment
const sendPushNotification = async (userId, title, body, data) => {
  const message = {
    to: userPushToken,
    sound: 'default',
    title: '🛒 New Sale!',
    body: 'Customer just purchased for $19.99. Tap to share activation code!',
    data: { type: 'sale', notificationId, amount },
    priority: 'high'
  };
  
  await expo.sendPushNotificationsAsync([message]);
};
```

#### Automatic Triggering
- Stripe webhook triggers push notifications
- User preferences respected (can disable notifications)
- Fallback handling for failed deliveries
- Token validation and cleanup
