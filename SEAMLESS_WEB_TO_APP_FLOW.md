# Seamless Web-to-App User Experience Flow

## Overview

We've implemented a revolutionary user experience that eliminates friction when transitioning from web QR code scanning to the mobile app. This system automatically creates user accounts, links activation codes to profiles, and guides users through a seamless app download process.

## Enhanced User Journey

### 🔄 **Before (Friction-Heavy)**
1. User scans QR code on web
2. Player tells them to download app
3. User downloads app
4. User must re-enter activation code in app
5. Multiple steps, easy to abandon

### ✅ **After (Seamless Experience)**
1. User scans QR code on web
2. User enters valid activation code
3. **Automatic account creation with code linking**
4. **Smart messaging prioritizes profile creation**
5. User creates profile → code automatically attached
6. Email verification → app download option presented
7. User downloads app → signs in → all codes already linked
