The error message {"error":"Route not found","method":"GET","path":"/api/stripe/health","server":"clean-server.js","timestamp":"2025-06-25T05:11:03.115Z"} is a 404 Not Found error from your Express.js server. This is a different kind of error than the path-to-regexp issue you were facing before.

This means:

Your Express.js server successfully started. (Good! The path-to-regexp issue is likely resolved, or at least the server is getting past that initial parsing phase).

The server received a GET request to the path /api/stripe/health.

Your server does not have a route defined that matches GET /api/stripe/health.

How to Solve "Route Not Found"
Here's a systematic approach to debug and fix this:

1. Verify the Route Definition:

Locate your server code (likely clean-server.js or index.js or files imported by them).

Search for routes related to /api/stripe/health. Look for lines like:

JavaScript

app.get('/api/stripe/health', (req, res) => { ... });
router.get('/health', (req, res) => { ... }); // if mounted at /api/stripe
Check for typos:

Is it health or healthy?

Is it stripe or strip?

Is it /api/stripe/health or /stripe/health or just /health?

Is the HTTP method correct? You're sending a GET request. Do you have an app.get for this path, or is it an app.post by mistake?

2. Route Order Matters:

In Express.js, middleware and route handlers are executed in the order they are defined. If you have a "catch-all" or 404 handler defined before your specific /api/stripe/health route, the catch-all will intercept the request before it ever reaches your intended route.

Make sure your specific routes are defined before any general 404 handler. A typical Express app structure looks like this:

JavaScript

const express = require('express');
const app = express();

// 1. Middleware (e.g., body-parser, CORS, authentication)
app.use(express.json());
app.use(express.urlencoded({ extended: true }));
// ... other middleware

// 2. ALL your specific API routes
app.get('/api/stripe/health', (req, res) => {
    res.status(200).json({ status: 'ok', message: 'Stripe health check passed' });
});
// app.post('/api/users', ...)
// app.use('/api/products', productRoutes); // If you're using Express Routers

// 3. Catch-all for unhandled routes (404 handler - MUST BE LAST)
app.use((req, res, next) => {
    res.status(404).json({
        error: 'Route not found',
        method: req.method,
        path: req.originalUrl,
        timestamp: new Date().toISOString()
    });
});

// 4. Global error handler (has 4 parameters)
app.use((err, req, res, next) => {
    console.error(err.stack); // Log the error stack for debugging
    res.status(500).json({
        error: 'Internal Server Error',
        message: err.message,
        timestamp: new Date().toISOString()
    });
});

const PORT = process.env.PORT || 3000;
app.listen(PORT, () => {
    console.log(`Server running on port ${PORT}`);
});
3. Check Router Mounting (if using express.Router()):

If your Stripe routes are in a separate file (e.g., stripeRoutes.js) and imported via express.Router(), ensure they are correctly mounted.

server.js (or index.js):

JavaScript

const stripeRoutes = require('./routes/stripeRoutes'); // Adjust path as needed
app.use('/api/stripe', stripeRoutes); // This mounts all routes from stripeRoutes at /api/stripe
routes/stripeRoutes.js (or similar):

JavaScript

const express = require('express');
const router = express.Router();

// This GET / will become GET /api/stripe/
router.get('/', (req, res) => {
    res.send('Stripe root');
});

// This GET /health will become GET /api/stripe/health
router.get('/health', (req, res) => {
    res.status(200).json({ status: 'ok', message: 'Stripe health check passed' });
});

module.exports = router;
In this scenario, if your route in stripeRoutes.js was defined as router.get('/api/stripe/health', ...) and then mounted with app.use('/api/stripe', stripeRoutes);, the effective path would become /api/stripe/api/stripe/health, which would lead to a 404. It should be router.get('/health', ...) when mounted at /api/stripe.

4. Debugging console.log:

Add console.log statements in your server to confirm execution flow.

In your Express app setup:

JavaScript

app.get('/api/stripe/health', (req, res) => {
    console.log('Received GET request for /api/stripe/health');
    res.status(200).json({ status: 'ok', message: 'Stripe health check passed' });
});
If you don't see this console.log output when you hit the endpoint, it means the request is not reaching that specific route handler.

5. How are you making the request?

Browser: If you're typing http://localhost:3000/api/stripe/health directly into your browser, it will make a GET request.

Postman/Insomnia/curl: Double-check that you're sending a GET request to the correct URL.

Frontend code (React, Vue, Angular, plain JS fetch): Verify the URL and method used in your frontend request. Is it axios.get('/api/stripe/health')?

In your specific case, since the error message clearly states /api/stripe/health as the path, the most likely solution is to:

Ensure you have a GET route defined for /api/stripe/health in your server code.

Verify that this specific route is placed before any generic 404 (catch-all) middleware in your clean-server.js or index.js.

Go through these steps, focusing on where GET /api/stripe/health should be handled, and you should be able to resolve the "Route not found" error.
