You're encountering the exact same error, "Missing parameter name at ${i}: ${DEBUG_URL}", but this time when running node index.js. This strongly confirms that the issue is not with clean-server.js specifically, but with your Express.js application's route definitions in general.

As discussed, this error is a breaking change in Express.js v5.x (which uses path-to-regexp@8.x.x). The problem stems from how path-to-regexp now handles route parameters, specifically for wildcards (*) and optional segments (?).

Since your previous attempt to run clean-server.js also yielded this error, it suggests that both clean-server.js and index.js (presumably your main server entry file) are experiencing this due to being part of the same project and likely using the same version of Express.js.

Recap of the Problem and Solution:
The error "Missing parameter name at ${i}: ${DEBUG_URL}" means you have a route defined in your Express application that uses an unnamed wildcard (*) or an optional parameter (?) without the new required syntax.

Common Culprits and Their Fixes:

Catch-all routes (*):

Old (Express v4.x and earlier):

JavaScript

app.all('*', (req, res) => {
    // ... 404 handler or static file serving
});
New (Express v5.x and later): You must give the wildcard a name.

JavaScript

app.all('/*splat', (req, res) => {
    // Access matched segments via req.params.splat
    // Example: if URL is /foo/bar, req.params.splat will be 'foo/bar'
});
// Alternatively, if you need to match the root path ('/') as well:
// app.all('/{*any}', (req, res) => {
//     // Access matched segments via req.params.any
// });
Optional parameters (?):

Old (Express v4.x and earlier):

JavaScript

app.get('/users/:id?', (req, res) => {
    // ...
});
New (Express v5.x and later): Use curly braces for optional segments.

JavaScript

app.get('/users{/:id}', (req, res) => {
    // req.params.id will still be available if present
});
Your Action Plan (Focused on index.js):
Open index.js (and any other files it imports that define Express routes). Your index.js is likely where your main Express app is initialized and routes are defined.

Scan your route definitions (app.get, app.post, app.use, router.get, router.post, etc.) for patterns like * or ?.

Identify and modify any routes that use these patterns without a named parameter.

Example: If you have app.use((req, res, next) => { ... }) this usually handles all routes, but if you pass a path, e.g., app.use('/api/*', ...) then that's where the problem could be.

Save all modified files.

Try running your server again:

Bash

cd server && node index.js
Important Considerations:

Express.js Version: Double-check your package.json file inside the server directory. Look at the dependencies or devDependencies section for "express". If it's "^5.0.0" or "5.x.x", then you are indeed on Express v5.

Downgrading Express (Temporary Fix): If you have a large application with many routes and don't want to refactor them immediately, a quick workaround is to explicitly downgrade Express to v4.x.

Go to your server directory: cd server

Uninstall current Express: npm uninstall express

Install Express v4: npm install express@4

Delete package-lock.json (or yarn.lock) and node_modules again, then run npm install one more time to ensure a clean state:

Bash

rm -rf node_modules
rm -f package-lock.json
npm install
Then try node index.js again.

By carefully examining your routes in index.js and any files it uses to define routes, you should be able to pinpoint the exact line causing this path-to-regexp error. The error message is very direct about the cause once you know what to look for!
